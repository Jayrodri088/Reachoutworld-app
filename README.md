When a user is registered, the data is stored in the database and can be accessed by the backend server, but if the user is not able to register, the approriate error message is displayed to the user which you can configure in the sign_up.dart file to display the actual error message from the backend server or that you wish the user to see.

After a successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page where the user can login to the app, the login details will be sent to the backend server for verification and if the login details are correct, the user is redirected to the dashboard where the user can access the app's features.

In the dashboard, there is a circle avatar that when clicked, allows the user to update their profile picture which will be stored in the database and can be accessed by the backend server, although the uploads folder is not ready yet but will be ready soon.
Then there is a sidebar that allows the user to navigate to the feedback page and logout button.
In the main part of the dashboard, there is a button that allows the user to access the data capture form where the user can enter the contact details of the individuals they meet during their outreach, the data is then stored in the database and can be accessed by the backend server.
There is also a media capture button where the user can capture photos or videos of their outreach moments, the media is then uploaded to the server and can be accessed by the backend server.
There is also a leaderboard button where the user can see how they rank on the leaderboard based on their outreach activities.

There are also bottom navigation bar that allows the user to navigate between the dashboard, recent activities, wallet and settings.

In the recent activities page, the user can see the recent activities of both the data capture and media capture.
